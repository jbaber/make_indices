Brittle way to create a collection of static gallery html pages

After

    pip3 install .

`make-indices --help` will show the flags to the executable script
`make-indices`.

If you manage to create and html files, you can host them locally
by

    $ python3 -m http.server 8080

and visiting http://localhost:8080

to see how things worked.
